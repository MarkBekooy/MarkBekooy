# Hey, I'm Mark 👋

I'm a solo founder and indie developer building AI-powered SaaS products. I love turning everyday frustrations into useful tools, starting with my own.

## What I'm Building

**[TypoSnap](https://typosnap.com)** - An AI-powered tool for catching spelling and grammar mistakes. Built because I genuinely can't stand typos (and neither should you).

I'm currently expanding TypoSnap's feature set and exploring new AI-driven products in the same space.

## Tech I Work With

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML:** LLM integrations, AI-powered content tools
- **Stack:** Full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript, PostgreSQL
- **Also skilled with:** Python, Docker, Microsoft Azure

## What I'm Up To

- 🔨 Building in public, sharing the wins, the mistakes and everything in between
- 🚀 Growing TypoSnap as a solo founder
- ✍️ Writing about decisions, mistakes and principles in AI product development
- 🤝 Connecting with other indie hackers and SaaS builders
